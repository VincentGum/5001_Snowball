1. task_1 fold contains code for task_1:

    a. run task_1.py as the main;
    b. stock_rsi.py would read quote.csv and transform it into features we need;
    c. states_1.py would generate the feature of the whole market and take it as state set
    d. q_1.py is the q-learning module
    e. output_1.py is separate from the the py file above, transform the output file into
       the form we use to backtest.

    Therefore, just run task_1.py and output_1.py.

2. task_3 fold contains code for task_3:

    a. run task_3.py as the main;
    b. states_3.py would generate the feature of the whole market and take it as state set
    c. q_3.py is the q-learning module
    d. output_3.py is separate from the the py file above, transform the output file into
       the form we use to backtest.

    Therefore, just run task_3.py and output_3.py.

3. fold 'Snowball' contains all the csv files

4. fold 'preprocess' contains code we wrote to extract features and do the starting analysis
   (which is no more use for the main part)

5. fold 'generated_data' csv files for features we extracted before
